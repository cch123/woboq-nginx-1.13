<doc f='include/pcre.h' l='98'>/* Public options. Some are compile-time only, some are run-time only, and some
are both. Most of the compile-time options are saved with the compiled regex so
that they can be inspected during studying (and therefore JIT compiling). Note
that pcre_study() has its own set of options. Originally, all the options
defined here used distinct bits. However, almost all the bits in a 32-bit word
are now used, so in order to conserve them, option bits that were previously
only recognized at matching time (i.e. by pcre_exec() or pcre_dfa_exec()) may
also be used for compile-time options that affect only compiling and are not
relevant for studying or JIT compiling.

Some options for pcre_compile() change its behaviour but do not affect the
behaviour of the execution functions. Other options are passed through to the
execution functions and affect their behaviour, with or without affecting the
behaviour of pcre_compile().

Options that can be passed to pcre_compile() are tagged Cx below, with these
variants:

C1   Affects compile only
C2   Does not affect compile; affects exec, dfa_exec
C3   Affects compile, exec, dfa_exec
C4   Affects compile, exec, dfa_exec, study
C5   Affects compile, exec, study

Options that can be set for pcre_exec() and/or pcre_dfa_exec() are flagged with
E and D, respectively. They take precedence over C3, C4, and C5 settings passed
from pcre_compile(). Those that are compatible with JIT execution are flagged
with J. */</doc>
